# Full-color-RGB-LED-Strip-Driver
Example driver for DX ledstrip module
http://www.dx.com/p/full-color-rgb-led-strip-driver-module-w-dc-jack-for-arduino-440804#.WH6XEPnhCUk

the arduino driver seemed very complex for adding values to a number and sending it as binary.

#Example usage
*SetColor(1,1,1)  -> turns on all tree colors
*SetColor(1,0,0) -> Red only
*SetColor(0,1,1) -> Green + Blue

Etc.
